    """ Trigger Renovate's own rebase/retry on a pull request, on the signed-in user's behalf

     Ticks the `rebase-check` checkbox in the named pull request's
    body (`- [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->...` becomes `- [x] ...`, and
    nothing else in the body changes) — Renovate's own documented
    rebase/retry trigger, which every Renovate pull request carries
    and which needs no setup. Renovate doesn't read comments as
    commands. When the body has no such checkbox, falls back to
    adding the signed-in user's own configured Renovate rebase label
    (Settings' "Renovate rebase label" field, defaulting to
    Renovate's own `rebase` if left blank). Works on both GitHub
    and Forgejo, unlike the Dependabot actions, since Renovate runs
    on both.

    A checkbox that is already ticked is not edited again: the
    answer is a 409 `ActionError` with `code: already_requested`.

    When the forge refuses, the server re-reads the pull request and
    answers an `ActionError` (see Merge): `already_merged` or
    `already_closed` when the row was stale, otherwise a `code` and a
    plain-words `message` safe to show a person.

    Args:
        body (PullRequestActionRequest): Which pull request to act on.

    Raises:
        errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
        httpx.TimeoutException: If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.
